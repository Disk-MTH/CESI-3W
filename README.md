## Worldwide Weather Watcher (3W), CESI 2023

### Description

This repository is the result of a projet for my engineering school.
This project is not intended to be modified in the future,
but I leave it in free access for those who may be interested.

dire que l'énoncé n'est aps fourni
/!\ The project statement is not provided because it is considered leaking private information and CESI formally prohibits it.

/!\ Some parts may be wrong, contains errors, I therefore decline all responsibility in the event of recopying caused by errors, this project is open-source for educational purposes

### Content

The code is a small weather station based on simple components:
- BME (temperature, humidity, pressure)
- RTC (to remember the date and time)
- SD (for data storage)
- GPS (for location)
- Analog brightness
- 2 control buttons

The main challenge was to optimize the code enough to fit into the limited memory of an Arduino Uno.
The code also comes with an automatic compilation script based on PlatformIO configurable with a configuration file
